Ch 7-12 are in progress

The Nand2Tetris project is a self-contained educational program aimed at teaching computer science from the ground up. It guides learners through the process of building a complete computer system, starting with the basic logic gates and ending with a functional software platform. Participants design and implement various components, including arithmetic logic units, memory units, an assembler, a virtual machine, a compiler, and an operating system. By following this hands-on approach, learners gain a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of a computer, from low-level hardware to high-level software, and develop practical programming skills along the way.
